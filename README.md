# Docker
I used the following articles to create my docker setup:
* https://medium.com/@MarinAgli1/setting-up-a-spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker-in-layman-terms-8cbdc9fdd14b
* https://github.com/mrn-aglic/pyspark-playground

*! Important book_data is the directory where I put the .csv files needed for assignment. spark_apps is the directory
where I store the python scripts for Apache Spark.*

# How to run the app
Run the following commands:
* make build-nc
* make run-d
* make submit app=main.py

# Output
The output is saved in the folder book_data/final_output and also printed in the console.
